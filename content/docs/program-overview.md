<h3 class="section-head" id="h-kick-off"><a href="#h-kick-off">Kick off!</a></h3>
<p>The program starts with a particuliar session as known as <i>kick-off</i>. The kick-off will be an event in itself. The practical details of your venue and attendees will be available <a href="/blog/wit-program-kick-off/">here</a> </p>
<p>During this session we will set up your developper's environment or check it out if you already finished with it (ref <a href="/docs/dev-env-install/">install your dev environment</a>)</p>
<p>We will present all the tools we will use to work together on site and online</p> 

<h3 class="section-head" id="h-fundamental-programming"><a href="#h-fundamental-programming">Fundamental programming</a></h3>
<p>The aim of this module is to harmonize the group's technical skills for programming. We use Javascript, first in the browser, and focus on the language itself.</p>
<p>At the end of this module the students shall be able to build a simple front-end application in a profesional software developer environment.</p>
<p>In details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Javascript #1</li>
    <li>Javascript #2</li>
    <li>Javascript #3</li>
    <li>Styling (HTML & CSS)</li>
    <li>Source code management and collaboration around the code</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-head" id="h-webapp-dev"><a href="#h-webapp-dev">Web application development</a></h3>
<p>We start moving towards the server in this module. We will be using Javascript on the server for two reasons: #1 keep on learning of the language and #2 re-use the knowledge of the first module to be able to faster start server-side development</p>
<p>By completing this module, students should be able to write simple services on the server that will later be reused with their front-end code of the first module.</p>
<p>In details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Architecture (HTTP, Rest, ...)</li>
    <li>Design of a webapp</li>
    <li>Server-side development with Javascript</li>
    <li>Persistence on the server (DBMS)</li>
    <li>Hackathon</li>
    <li>Team work and project management</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="section-head" id="h-software-delivery"><a href="#h-software-delivery">Software delivery</a></h3>
<p>This module will set all the previous work in a global perspective: a developer builds software for <i>someone</i>. It means that the students will have to work with concepts like requirements, testing, quality, build, release, and delivery. They will also enhance their technical skills on topics like systems, security and cloud computing</p>
<p>As a final assignment the students will present the result of their work: a state-of-the-art online web application</p>

<p>In details:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Build pipeline</li>
    <li>Case</li>
    <li>Security of a web application</li>
    <li>Software delivery</li>
    <li>Cloud computing</li>
</ul>
